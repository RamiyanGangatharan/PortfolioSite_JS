      "My name is Ramiyan Gangatharan. I am a dedicated programmer with a passion for creating innovative software solutions. I am currently in the Computer Programming & Analysis program at Durham College, with previous experience from a programming boot camp and two semesters at Centennial College in the Software Engineering Technology program. With this background in computers and software development, I have honed my skills in various programming languages including Python, Java, C#, C++, COBOL, JCL, HTML, CSS, JS, and SQL. I specialize in creating robust and aesthetic applications and have extensive experience working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).",
      "Currently, I am creating this website as well as developing a C# application that tracks my spending habits through the power of SQL and the .NET framework. I work at Tim Hortons and have been there since November 2021, where I am a shift leader for the afternoon shift. When I am not working or coding, you can catch me reading a book, playing a video game, or watching my favorite shows and movies. I am always excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities in the technological world. Feel free to contact me for collaborations or to hang out if you're in the area."
