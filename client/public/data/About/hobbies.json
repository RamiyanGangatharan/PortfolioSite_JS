      "description": [
        "My interest in computers began at a young age when I first used a computer in my elementary school's computer lab in the late 2000s, running Windows XP. From that moment, I was hooked and started tinkering with computers. By the age of 16, I began dismantling and rebuilding PCs. I did this for two reasons: my old PC was outdated, and I wanted to experience the process of custom-building a PC. I found it fascinating to see how all the components fit together.",
        "I started programming in grade 10 with a Java class that introduced me to the basics of programming, as well as some technical and engineering aspects of software development, such as gathering requirements from users and converting ASCII characters to binary. Since high school, I have been experimenting with Java and other languages like Python and C#. In September 2021, I began my academic journey at Centennial College, studying in the Software Engineering Technology program for two semesters before realizing it wasn't the right fit for me. I then switched to the Computer Programming & Analysis program at Durham College, where I am now starting my third year. I plan to graduate from this program and pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at a reputable university in Ontario.",
        "My experience over the years has been shaped by a lot of trial and error, working on incomplete prototypes and learning from mistakes. From 2021 to 2024, I have created various pieces of software, including websites, games, databases and their interfaces, surveys, and some minor robotic projects. My colleagues often say that I have 'an eye for design,' which has been crucial in creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing software. I am always curious and eager to learn new concepts, constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.",
        "In conclusion, my journey with computers and programming has been driven by a passion for technology and a relentless curiosity to learn and grow. As I continue to develop my skills and pursue higher education, I am excited about the future opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the field of computer science."

        "Reading is a newer hobby for me. I didn't like reading as a child, but I discovered it as a hobby when we didn't have internet for a month while moving. I started with children's books I had, then began buying proper novels. Reading isn't like other hobbies that energize you; it calms me down, depending on the book."
