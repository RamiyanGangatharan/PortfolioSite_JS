        "section_title": "The History of Software Development Languages",
        "content": "The history of software development languages highlights a remarkable evolution from C's structured foundation in 1972 to C++ in 1985 and Java's object-oriented concepts in 1995, Python's simplicity and versatility in 1991, and C#'s modern features by 2002. This progression mirrors the software industry's ongoing quest for efficiency, versatility, and user-friendliness, with each language making unique contributions to a rich application development ecosystem. C, pioneered by Dennis Ritchie, established a basis for systems programming like operating systems and kernel based applications, while C++, by Bjarne Stroustrup, and Java, by Sun Microsystems, introduced object-oriented features and cross-platform capabilities, respectively. Python, developed by Guido van Rossum, emphasized readability and ease of use, whereas Microsoft's C# merged the efficiency of C++ with Java's simplicity to boost developer productivity. This journey emphasises the shift toward more accessible and advanced programming frameworks, highlighting the critical need for adaptability and lifelong learning among developers to address the complexities of current and future computing challenges. The dynamic nature of programming, driven by emerging technologies and evolving user demands, encourages us to stay agile, embrace new paradigms, and contribute to innovative software solutions that will define our digital future."

        "section_title": "Language Syntax, Structure, and Perspectives",
        "content": "The syntax and structure of programming languages influence how developers, including myself, engage with technology. Syntax dictates how we write our applications, while structure organizes the code in the application, impacting code usability and maintainability. Through my time at Centennial College for Software Engineering Technology, Durham College for Computer Programming and Analysis, and in addition to some side projects, I've navigated the nuances of both statically and dynamically typed languages.\nStatically typed languages, such as C++, Java, and C#, require explicit type declarations, offering granular control while adding complexity. This control is beneficial for complex applications, like the database interfaces and a Blackjack game I’ve made at Durham College, where the structured nature of C# was important towards the amount of control I wanted. Compared to C++, Java is similar in its static typing as it adds robust object-oriented features, reinforcing code safety and predictability, essential for enterprise-grade applications I encountered at both Durham College and Centennial College. \nConversely, Python's dynamic typing simplifies development by allowing implicit type declarations, which I found advantageous for smaller-scale projects and API integrations. This ease of use accelerates development cycles, although it can pose challenges in debugging and scalability for larger projects. Modern IDEs, with features like type inference and real-time error checks, have been crucial in navigating these challenges, enhancing productivity regardless of the language's typing system. My experiences emphasize the importance of selecting the right language, balancing between simplicity for rapid development and the need for explicit control in complex systems. This journey has not only honed my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of software development."

        "section_title": "Platform Compatibility",
        "content": "Platform compatibility comes in various forms where it includes cross platform use cases, libraries, API’s, runtime environments, compilers, and the support behind it from the original developers or by forums created by users of the language. C++ is meant to be written once and compiled everywhere as it is a kernel level language where it compiles straight to machine code and so it can run anywhere that uses assembly as a language at its lowest level. Java has a similar motto to C++ where they say write once, run anywhere. Java’s compatibility takes a little detour where it runs through a virtual machine as it compiles into machine code. Like Java, C# runs through a virtual machine, but Microsoft has a system called the common runtime language where it goes through an intermediary codebase to compile to machine code. Python was intentionally designed to be cross platform in the modern age where if you create a program in Windows, it can run on Linux and MacOS without any change to the code. In this generation of the general population using many different devices at the same time, it is important that languages can be supported on multiple devices as compared to the years before 2000, you needed specific devices for specific use cases but now, you can use the same device, created by different companies and languages all in the same device."

        "section_title": "Performance and Efficiency",
        "content": "In programming, performance and efficiency vary significantly across languages. High-level languages like Python prioritize development speed and ease of use over granular control and compile performance, making them ideal for rapid prototyping and smaller projects. Despite this, their simplicity often comes at the cost of execution speed and efficiency, as highlighted by the insights from LogicMonitor (2022).\nConversely, low-level languages such as C++ offer superior execution efficiency, enabling direct hardware interaction and precise memory management. This capability, as Kennedy et al. (2004) and Miller (2021) note, positions C++ as a preferred choice for system-level programming and high-performance applications like operating systems and kernel level applications. However, it also creates a steeper learning curve and more complex development processes due to manual memory management and its various risks with it as I will explain in the next section. Java and C# find a middle ground, providing a blend of high-level ease and efficient execution by compiling statically typed code into intermediate code that runs on virtual machines (Java Virtual Machine for Java and Common Language Runtime for C#). This method ensures a degree of portability and efficiency, making these general purpose languages versatile for a wide range of applications.\nFor students with a programming background, understanding these trade-offs is essential. The choice between the rapid development offered by languages like Python and the execution efficiency of languages like C++ depends on the project's specific demands, such as execution speed versus development speed and the project's scale and complexity. This nuanced view, grounded in the foundational principles from Kennedy et al. (2004) and supplemented by insights from Miller (2021) and LogicMonitor (2022), aids in selecting the most suitable language for your projects. I would recommend C# or Java for your average software development projects to reduce the complexity while keeping the granularity of your application at hand."

        "section_title": "Memory Management",
        "content": "Memory management is a vital component of software development, encompassing the allocation, oversight, and eventual deallocation of memory to ensure its efficient use and prevent issues like memory leaks and pointer misuse. The concept of a memory hierarchy, as explained by Baker & Florida State University (2002), offers a structured perspective on memory's organization and management across various levels, delineating a path from the fastest to the slowest forms of memory. At the pinnacle of this hierarchy sits the CPU cache (L1, L2, L3, and L4), the quickest type of memory managed directly by the CPU for temporary storage of frequently accessed data and instructions, like the immediate but short-term recall required for routine tasks in life (Intel, n.d.). Just below in the hierarchy is random access memory (RAM), acting as the primary workspace for the computer by temporarily holding data and instructions for active processes. Its volatile nature, where data is lost upon power loss, it can be compared to the short-term thoughts or a mental checklist that fades once no longer needed. Anchoring the hierarchy, secondary storage devices such as hard drives and solid state drives offer persistent storage for long-term data retention, just like the knowledge of your name or age, albeit at the slowest access speeds."

      {
        "section_title": "Memory Management Requirements",
        "content": "Effective memory management is crucial for computing systems and encompasses several key requirements, as identified by Baker & Florida State University (2002). The first of these is relocation, which addresses the need for programs to operate without fixed memory locations, allowing their contents to move within the memory space, including to and from secondary storage, as required during execution. Protection, the second requirement, ensures that memory segments can only be accessed by authorized processes, safeguarding against unauthorized references that may arise due to the dynamic computation of addresses at runtime. Sharing, another essential aspect, allows multiple applications to concurrently access the same sector of memory, enabling both execute-only access to programs and read-write access to shared resources like databases. The fourth requirement, logical organization, supports modular programming by facilitating the dynamic loading of program modules into memory, where copies of these modules can be shared among processes, leading to a segmented memory architecture. Lastly, physical organization is crucial as it requires memory to be structured hierarchically into levels such as main (CPU cache & RAM) and secondary memory, accommodating the specific access patterns dictated by the operating system and hardware at any given time. Together, these principles form the foundation of efficient memory management, ensuring dynamic program execution in a multitasking environment."
      },
      {
        "section_title": "Memory Manipulation",
        "content": "C++ is celebrated for its robust memory management features, granting developers precise control over memory allocation, usage, and deallocation. This granular control is notably facilitated by pointers, which play a pivotal role in memory efficiency. Pointers are special variables that store the memory address of another variable (like you remembering your home address), rather than the variable's value itself. For instance, if we have a variable ‘int Beta = 10;’, a pointer ‘int* Alpha’ can be used to store the address of Beta. Rather than of holding a value directly, Alpha points to the location where Beta's value is stored in memory (Florida State University, n.d.) in which tells the computer to look at that address for the information it requires. \nThis indirect access allows for dynamic memory management, such as allocating memory at runtime, passing large structures or classes to functions without copying the entire object, and facilitating dynamic data structures like lists. John France, who is a friend and classmate of mine explained pointers to me where he described that creating a new variable and assigning the same data to it as another variable is like doing a photocopy of all the data in that memory address requiring lots of processing power and storage capacity. Rather than creating a new copy of the same variable, by using pointers you can direct it to the variable that holds the original data. Its like telling someone what page a certain document is rather than them having to read the entire book and recording its data, then finding what they needed, therefore saving time by directly going to the information needed and saving computing power by reducing the load created by copying."
      },
      {
        "section_title": "Object Oriented Programming Principles",
        "content": "The four principles of object oriented programming are inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. Inheritance allows a class to take properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called a subclass (or derived class), and the class being inherited from is called a superclass (or base class). This principle supports code reusability and hierarchical classification. For instance, considering a base class Animal, you might have subclasses like Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal, each with additional characteristics or behaviors specific to that type of animal. A dog may be an animal but is different from a cat like its size, behaviour, and diet. \nEncapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class, and controlling access to the internals of that class. This principle is often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside. This is typically achieved using access modifiers like public, private, and protected, allowing the class to restrict access to its members. For example, a class BankAccount may have a private method to calculate interest, which cannot be accessed from outside the class, ensuring that the internal process is hidden and secure. \nPolymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It's the ability of a single function or method to work in diverse ways depending on the object it is called on. This can be achieved through method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and overriding (redefining a superclass method in a subclass). For example, a draw() method might be implemented differently in Circle, Square, and Triangle classes, but a single draw() method call can be used to draw the appropriate shape, depending on the type of object it's called on. \nAbstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. In a way, it's an extension of encapsulation, focusing on the interface that an object presents to the outside world while keeping the implementation details private. For example, a car can be driven without knowing the intricacies of how its engine works. In programming, interfaces and abstract classes are used to achieve abstraction. \nTogether, these principles form the foundation of OOP, enabling developers to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Each principle plays a crucial role in the design and implementation of object-oriented systems, facilitating better software design and architecture."

        "section_title": "Rapid Application Development",
        "content": "According to (outsystems, n.d.), “rapid application development is an agile software development approach that focuses more on ongoing software projects and user feedback and less on following a strict plan. Such as it emphasizes rapid prototyping over costly planning”. The method of rapid application development consists of requirement definitions, prototyping, feedback, and the final product. Rapid application development starts with collecting requirements from the users to create a prototype. That prototype then gets tested and acquires feedback from both users and staff. Once they have that feedback, it can go one of two ways; it either does well and can be released (which may not be the case) or it receives feedback, and a new iteration of the prototype is formed. Once this process is done and the product is refined and revised, it is released as an official product. Rapid application development may seem good in small teams but can become difficult with larger teams or multiple teams."

        "section_title": "The Popularity of Programming Languages & My Recommendation",
        "content": "Looking at the data from (Statista, 2022), out of the programming languages I have compared in this report, Python comes first in the tier list. In second place is Java, followed by C#, C++, then C. From my observations, the newer languages and iterations of previous languages are more popular as they are better than older languages. I agree with this order as Python is the latest language to emerge into the world as it keeps the functionality C++ but makes development simpler as of syntax specifications. Although Python may be the latest and the greatest in 2024, C# is my recommendation for the overall best programming language for general programming applications where it keeps the syntax of C++ and C but offers the protections and portability of Java where it stops your application before it crashes. But I cannot stop here as there are many ways you can use a language. If you need to create lightweight applications that interface with APIs to manage the heavy workloads, you can use Python. If you need to make large scale applications that need granular control, I recommend C++ over C# for that application."
